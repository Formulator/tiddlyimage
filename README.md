# TiddlyImage
## Beautifully curate, annotate & compose visual narratives.

- Designed so that you can easily collect, upload, compose and interact with images.

- View it anywhere.  Share it online or keep it private, your choice!

- Gamified imagery consumption.  Learn from your collection, without realising!

- Checkout the [demo](https://formulator.github.io/tiddlyimage/)

## Envisaged uses
- Curation & presentation of specialist image collections.
- Develop visual recognition skills of....*whatever*....you decide.
- A tool for learning & pleasure.
- An open-source [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) demo app.

## Goals    
- Intuitive, slick interface facilitating batch upload, grouping and annotation of resources.
- Import/export via JSON files :heavy_check_mark: Solved by TiddlyWiki core :heavy_check_mark:
- Easily build narratives from related images.
- Keep responsive performance whilst managing several hundred / a few thousand images with the scheme.
- Create interface tiddlers which compose narratives and/or slice the data in interesting directions.
e.g.
    - Build tiddler to display narratives at random. 
    - Build game tiddlers which present images at random based on user tag selection and match user guesses to actual tags, keep score.

## Questions    
-    Is the extended interface best implemented as a tiddler or a TiddlyWiki plugin?
-    Do you have the skills to help build it?  Please join me on GitHub code contributions and comments are welcome. :heart_eyes:


## Roadmap
- ~~Local-but-external-file-import~~ Via plugin: [ServerImages](https://github.com/OokTech/TW5-ServerImages)
- ~~Prepare sample images~~ [See here](https://github.com/Formulator/tiddlyimage/tree/main/source_images)
- ~~Create GitHub repo, build first (limited functionality) demo and host on GitHub Pages.~~
- ~~Callout for skills & help~~
- Explore for plugins & snippets which solve aspects of desired functionality.
- Build necessary interface & functions
    - Batch file upload/list-of-links, annotate, group(assign uuid), date & time parsing and tiddler data enrichment.
    - Provide functionality to accommodate user scenarios; remote-url-hosted-images, adjacent-folder-images, local-but-external-images & images-embedded-in-the-wiki.
    - Option to build a grouped narrative tiddler at input time.
    - Option to export the JSON/csv pertinent to that input episode.
    - Option to Parse date and time from filenames to facilitate sorting and selection etc.  User provides the filename format?
    - Create as a TiddlyWiki plugin?
- Create mechanisms for users to filter, select and display the collection.
- Tiddlers to auto display random/chosen images/narratives.
- Develop interactive gamified interface.

## Future
- A distributed, collaborative, image-led wiki?
- A source of labelled data for machine learning?
- Blockchain derived commercial image licensing.  Revenue to the rights holder?
